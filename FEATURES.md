## 📝 NOTES

### Current State
- Frontend structure is solid with excellent design implementation
- All static pages are functional with placeholder content
- Animations and interactions work well
- Responsive design is implemented
- Missing dynamic backend entirely

### Immediate Needs
1. Set up Supabase database schema
2. Implement authentication system
3. Build admin panel for content management
4. Connect forms to database
5. Create missing pages (RTCON, news detail, gallery, etc.)

### Technical Debt
- No TypeScript errors currently
- No form validation implemented
- No error handling for API calls
- All data is hardcoded (needs CMS integration)
- Missing image assets (using placeholders)
- No SEO optimization
- No performance optimization (lazy loading, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started with Next Steps

To continue development, prioritize:
1. Database schema design (see mandatory_database_requirements)
2. Authentication implementation (see mandatory_auth_requirements)
3. CMS integration for news/events
4. File upload for memberships
5. Payment gateway integration
